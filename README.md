**Hello and Welcome!!!**

This repository consists of following files:

- **modeling.ipynb**: this file contains instructions for modeling part of the project. We recommend to split modeling tasks into more notebooks.
- **data_description.md**: if you are looking for any information regarding specific attributes in the data this is the file to look in.
- **sample_submission.csv**: this file is an example how the submission for the modeling task should look like.

### Data

We will be working with data from air travel industry. We will have four separate tables:

1. **flights**: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in years 2018 and 2019.
2. **fuel_comsumption**: The fuel comsumption of different airlines from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month.
3. **passengers**: The passenger totals on different routes from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month.
5. **flights_test**: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in January 2020. This table will be used for evaluation. We are required to predict delays on flights from first 7 days of 2020 (1st of January - 7th of January). We can find sample submission in file _sample_submission.csv_
